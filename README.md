# 1C.-Volume-Weighted-Trading
Project Overview

Volatility Volcano Manager is an advanced volatility regime classification and risk management platform built using machine learning and quantitative finance techniques.
The system identifies volatility regimes, predicts regime transitions, and adapts trading and risk strategies dynamically under changing market conditions.

This project focuses on volatility clustering, regime switching, and risk-aware decision systems, combining statistical models with ML-driven insights.
